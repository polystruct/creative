# Knowledge and Styling for Minecraft

I am an amateur minecraft builder, but enjoy it very much. While I am not
natively creative I enjoy learning from others and applying it in my own
worlds.

This project will host information about building styles, world creation (with
WorldPainter, WorldEdit) and commands (for the lore!) which I've found online,
and structured in a way that allows me to more quickly address it.

The site is published through GitHub Pages, and is available at
[Polystruct's Creative Minecraft](https://polystruct.github.io/creative/).
