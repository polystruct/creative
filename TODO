General
=======

Make sure the final pictures are sufficiently small.

First, crop out what isn't needed. Try to get the final picture to a resolution
of 1024x768. I apply cropping as the pictures I take have a somewhat distorted
view (due to laptop settings) at the edges.

```
~$ convert screenshot.png -gravity Center -crop 1024x768+0+0 intermediate.png
```

Next I use `pngquant` to optimize the PNG image further, unless the image is
already using 8-bit coloring (which can be seen using `identify`). Screenshots
from within Minecraft seem to already use 8-bit coloring to start.

```
~$ identify intermediate.png
~$ pngquant intermediate.png --speed 1 -o intermediate2.png
```

If the resulting image is above 200kB, I switch to JPG and force a size around
128Kb. Convert the image to JPEG (which will result in quality reduction, but
also reduces the resulting size tremendously):

```
~$ convert intermediate2.png final.jpg
~$ jpegoptim -S128 final.jpg
```


Update loot tables
==================

I'm updating the loot tables of the chests in the residential areas to be
conform the documented loot tables (e.g. for a farmer in a snowy biome hamlet,
use `polystruct:chests/hamlet/snowy/farmer`).

Hamlets
-------

badlands: done
desert: done
plains: done
savanna: done
snowy plains: todo
swamp: todo
taiga: todo

Villages
--------

badlands: todo
desert: todo
plains: done
taiga: todo

Studios and Rooms
=================

My intention is to build more studios and rooms. The builds themselves are
stored in a `generic` location, but the template pools will have separate
definitions, so that I can use _transformers_ to change chest loot tables
or common slabs and chairs.

The intention is also that there is a chance that a chest or barrel is
removed. This way, not all buildings that are stored with a chest/barrel
with loot will actually be on the final generation with loot. Preferably,
the chest/barrel is removed (and not its loot table changed) as I could
otherwise have the impression that I have a wrong build (wrong loot table).
