General
=======

Make sure the final pictures are sufficiently small.

First, crop out what isn't needed. Try to get the final picture to a resolution
of 1024x768. I apply cropping as the pictures I take have a somewhat distorted
view (due to laptop settings) at the edges.

```
~$ convert screenshot.png -gravity Center -crop 1024x768+0+0 intermediate.png
```

Next I use `pngquant` to optimize the PNG image further, unless the image is
already using 8-bit coloring (which can be seen using `identify`). Screenshots
from within Minecraft seem to already use 8-bit coloring to start.

```
~$ identify intermediate.png
~$ pngquant intermediate.png --speed 1 -o intermediate2.png
```

If the resulting image is above 200kB, I switch to JPG and force a size around
128Kb. Convert the image to JPEG (which will result in quality reduction, but
also reduces the resulting size tremendously):

```
~$ convert intermediate2.png final.jpg
~$ jpegoptim -S128 final.jpg
```
