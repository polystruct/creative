To help in data pack development, I currently use several online resources.

# Online data pack repositories and code

[misode](https://misode.github.io/) has online generators, but I personally
like to dive through the code they have available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/misode).

Other useful data packs are:
* [Dreamland](https://github.com/Alumopper/Dreamland/blob/master/Dreamland/data)
* [Wabi Sabi Structures](https://github.com/WightofShadows/Wabi_Sabi_Structures/tree/main/data/wabi_sabi_structures)

# Online content creators

I follow a few content creators that have a more technical view on data packs
(and mods), or frequently give a list of recent/new data packs. The list below
is in alphabetical order:

- [AsianHalfSquat](https://www.youtube.com/c/asianhalfsquat) regularly reviews mods.
- [unsorted guy](https://www.youtube.com/c/unsortedguy) has plenty of videos in
  which he plays custom modded minecraft worlds, together with his friends. His
  videos are inspirational to show what one can do within Minecraft with data
  packs and mods.
- [WafflesAreBetter](https://www.youtube.com/c/WafflesAreBetter/) has videos on
  the more technical minecraft side, such as structure blocks, data pack
  development, custom dimensions, etc.
