# Creative Minecraft

The intention of *Polystruct's Creative Minecraft* is to list ideas and
examples for building inside and with minecraft. It is meant as a reference for
when I build in worlds, which is what I prefer in Minecraft. As I am really just 
an amateur, having these references available allows me to quickly establish
what I want to do without having to find examples online over and over again.

For me, creative minecraft is more than in-game minecraft creative gamemode. It
focuses on world building (both from a visual style, such as custom maps, as
well as lore development) and reusability. For the latter, it is my intention to
have many of the ideas worked out in a datapack (which I will release once it is
a bit more established than what I have right now).

The document has a number of sections:

- [WorldPainter](worldpainter.html) focuses on creating custom worlds with
  WorldPainter and supporting tools.
- [Residential](residential.html) looks into residential builds
  within Minecraft. 
- [Data pack](datapack.html) provides more input on data pack
  development, and the data packs that I want to maintain related to this
  guide.

I hope having this material available online can be of assistance for others who
like growing in their creative minecraft endeavors.
