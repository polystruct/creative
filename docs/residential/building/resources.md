Creating one building isn't that hard, but creating multiple buildings in the
same style, that's something I struggle with. I use a few helplines to keep
inspiration and challenges alive.

# Online content creators

I love to learn from online content creators, and try to follow multiple. There
are many, many builders online. My own inspiration comes from the following
creators, in alphabetical order:

- [BdoubleO100](https://www.youtube.com/c/bdoubleo) has a great eye for detail,
  and often experiments with colors and shades (something I am fully ignorant
  of myself) as well as build styles. His videos are very entertaining as well.
  He has playlists for help with building, where he explains his thought
  process.
- [BlueNerd Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/c/BlueNerdMinecraft) has plenty
  of transformation and larger builds, but I personally like his eye for
  detail: not too crowded, fitting within the general build style, and with
  good eye for dimensions.
- [fWhip](https://www.youtube.com/c/fWhip) is a master builder with an eye for
  detail, and isn't shy from massive projects. He strives for consistent build
  styles within one area (so his towns/cities have a common theme to it) and
  tries to stick to the environment he gets, although he isn't shy of
  transforming the environment to make it even more grand. In his videos he often
  explains how the style works and why he made one choice over another.
- [GemeniTay](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeminiTayMC) has a soft and inspiring
  view on build styles. She covers different buildings (bridges, towers,
  castles, ...) and also likes the more fantasy-style build crafts.
- [Jeracraft](https://www.youtube.com/c/Jeracraft) creates massive, massive,
  massive, did I say already massive builds in Minecraft? While he was recently
  attacked by hackers/scammers, I hope he can get back to bringing us inspiring
  massive (here we go again) builds.
- [Keralis](https://www.youtube.com/c/Keralis) is a perfect content creator to
  follow if you like modern style builds. His builds are also focusing on the
  finishing touches, never just a single building but an entire area that fits
  in the style.
- [Lerfin](https://www.youtube.com/c/Lerfing) creates massive builds, and often
  focuses on large scale individual projects (including worldpainter-assisted
  creations).
- [McMeddon](https://www.youtube.com/c/McMeddon) is a custom map creator, using
  tools like WorldPainter and Gaea/WorldMachine for creating magnificent
  landscapes.
- [MegRae](https://www.youtube.com/c/MegRae) is a major inspiration for
  'organic' builds, and also has very nice more structural builds to show.
- [NashCrafter](https://www.youtube.com/c/NashCrafter) creates nice-looking
  builds that just fit within the Minecraft style. Her survival let's play
  videos are a joy to follow, with a relaxing pace.
- [PearlescentMoon](https://www.youtube.com/c/PearlescentMoon) can sculpt
  magnificent entities in Minecraft, and is a perfect content creator to follow
  when you're looking at building for other things than just, well, buildings:
  bridges, portals, tunnels, trees, ... 
- [Prideceratops](https://www.youtube.com/c/Prideceratops/) provides nice
  builds and designs without being overly detailed. His videos are mostly about
  survival, but shows how even in survival and without too much time to devote,
  you can still create nice looking structures.
- [SmallishBeans](https://www.youtube.com/c/SmallishBeans/) isn't shy of
  massive builds, and many of his videos are about his build endeavors. I'm
  always baffled about how much he realizes in one video, and he has videos
  every few days!
- [TheMythicalSausage](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheMythicalSausage) is a very
  energetic builder, not shy of a joke here and there, and just builds and
  builds and builds. I love how he continuously tries to add lore to his
  builds.
