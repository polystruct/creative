# Color palette

I'm slightly colorblind, and fail hard in selecting matching colors. Try living
with that if you have a daughter. But people make due, and I learned from
[fWhip's build style
post](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/how-to-build-different-styles-in-minecraft-114-tips-and-tricks-youtube--825003225474967233/) 
to use color wheels, such as [Adobe's color
wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) selecting complementary
colors. Using color pickers on minecraft pictures can help me adjust color
schemes - although most of the time I just copy color palettes I find online.

# Floors and streets

The ratios given are not necessarily percentages, but can be used as such with WorldEdit
(as WorldEdit will automatically use this as ratios). 

## Outside stone streets

When using gray-ish stone floors, the following mixture seems to work pretty well.

| Block       | Ratio |
|:------------|:------|
| Stone       | 11    |
| Andesite    | 17    |
| Stone brick | 9     |

## Inside stone floor

Factories could use a more reddish approach.

| Block            | Ratio |
|:-----------------|:------|
| Bricks           | 12    |
| Granite          | 19    |
| Polished granite | 6     |
